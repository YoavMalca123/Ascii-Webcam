This project uses flask for creating a simple webpage, and then using cv2,numpy and pil we are able to take a live video of our webcam and turn it into an ascii work of art.
you can change the ascii art's RGB values by simply entering them and pressing "submit". 
you can "toggle" between colorful and black and white versions of the ascii code by simply typing "-1,-1,-1" or "0,0,0" accordingly.
